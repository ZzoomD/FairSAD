# FairSAD
A PyTorch implementation of "[Fair Graph Representation Learning via Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645532)"

## Overview
FairSAD is a disentangled-based method to improve the fairness of GNNs while preserving task-related information. **The core idea behind FairSAD is to minimize the impact of the sensitive attribute on final predictions**.
